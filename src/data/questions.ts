export const questions = [
  {
    question: "What technologies do you specialize in?",
    answer:
      "I specialize in React and more recently Next.js for frontend development, and I'm expanding my expertise in Node.js and backend development to build full-stack applications.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Are you comfortable building both frontend and backend applications?",
    answer:
      "Yes! While my background is strongest in frontend development with React and Next.js, I am now also proficient in creating backend APIs, server-side logic, and database integration using Node.js.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of projects do you enjoy building?",
    answer:
      "I love building fast, interactive, and visually polished web applications. Projects where user experience, performance, and scalability all come together.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why did you choose React and Next.js?",
    answer:
      "Coming from a background in React Native, React’s component-based architecture makes UI development modular and efficient. Next.js adds production-ready features like routing, API routes, and server components, helping me deliver scalable full-stack apps.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure your code is maintainable?",
    answer:
      "I use TypeScript for type safety, ESLint and Prettier for consistency, and Jest/Vitest or React Testing Library for testing. I also keep a clear folder structure to make scaling easier.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle state management?",
    answer:
      "I use React Query (TanStack) for server state, and Zustand or Context for light global state. Even though I've used Redux in the past, I prefer simple, predictable state solutions over heavy frameworks unless truly needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle backend logic in your apps?",
    answer:
      "Depending on the project, I use Next.js API routes or a standalone Node.js + Express server. I rely on REST principles and Prisma ORM or similar ORMs for type-safe, structured database access.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you optimize performance and SEO?",
    answer:
      "I use Next.js static generation, image optimization, and lazy loading, alongside Lighthouse audits and Web Vitals. I also ensure strong metadata and semantic structure for SEO.",
  },
  {
    question: "What design systems or UI libraries do you use?",
    answer:
      "I often use ShadCN/UI or Material UI for accessibility and customization, combined with Tailwind CSS for layout and responsive design.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you stay up to date with modern web development?",
    answer:
      "I follow official React and Vercel updates, follow various newsletters, do Udemy courses, explore GitHub discussions, and build small playground projects to test new patterns.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you approach collaboration and teamwork?",
    answer:
      "I use GitHub Projects or Jira issues, and PR reviews to stay organized and transparent. I write clean commits, document key decisions, and prioritize clear communication.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you deploy full-stack applications?",
    answer:
      "Yes, I deploy using Vercel, Railway, or Docker. I handle both frontend and backend deployments, environment variables, and CI/CD setup for a complete delivery pipeline.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are you learning next?",
    answer:
      "I'm diving deeper into backend architecture and system design. Exploring topics like tRPC, microservices, event-driven architecture, authentication/authorization best practices, scalable API design, cloud deployments, serverless computing, and advanced database design to strengthen my full-stack expertise.",
  },
  {
    question: "What’s your coding philosophy?",
    answer:
      "“Make it work. Make it clean. Make it fast.” I believe well-written code feels invisible. Get it working and don't overcomplicate cause well written code can always scale, be optimized, and improved. Users just experience that it works beautifully.",
  },
  {
    question: "Coffee or tea while coding?",
    answer: "Coffee in the morning, decaf coffee or rooibos tea after 1pm.",
  },
